The very first Star Wars was released in 1977, and the original trilogy continued through 1983. Since then several more films were made between 2001 and 2019. We can see immediately into the late 70s, when the world-wide popular movies was released, there was a sharp increase in the number of children named luke, and continued to rise into the 21st century. However, while it seems fitting that the Star Wars films would cause such a cultural naming shift, I believe other circumstances contributed to the increase. It is clear that movies can have an impact on the names that parents give to children, but this perhaps not to the degree that this chart portrays.\n\n\nRead and format data\n# Include and execute your code here\nluke = df.query('name == \"Luke\"')\n\n\n::: {#cell-Luke Name Line Plot .cell execution_count=12}\n\nline plot for naming trends\n# Line Plot to explore Luke after Star Wars\nlukeChart = px.line(luke,\n    x='year',\n    y='Total')\nlukeChart.show()\n\n\n                                                \nLuke After Star Wars\n\n:::",
